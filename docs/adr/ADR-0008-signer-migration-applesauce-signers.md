# ADR-0008: Signer Migration to applesauce-signers

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-08-27 (revised 2026-09-01: reframed to the `master` baseline and renumbered 0022 → 0008, per PR #1252 review; revised 2026-09-04: locked the NIP-46 trust/identity chain and the signer capability seam as invariants, and reconciled the signer registry with the `src/AGENTS.md` import rule)

## Related

- ADR-0002 (Nostr I/O migration; Waves A3/A3b deferred the signer paths — this ADR specifies them)
- ADR-0010 (Cashu wallet; **Proposed via PR #1255**, file `ADR-0010-cashu-wallet-deps-recovery-sync.md`; shares the unified target stack — wallet seat only)
- Supersedes no prior ADR. Wave A3b supersedes the implementation approach of PR #1199 (see "Sequencing").

## Context

All four login paths sign through NDK signers, centered on `src/lib/stores/auth.ts`
(371 lines on current `master`):

| Login path       | Current implementation (`master`)                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NIP-46 bunker    | `NDKNip46Signer` (`auth.ts:250`)                                     |
| NIP-07 extension | `NDKNip07Signer` (`auth.ts:208`)                                     |
| nsec raw key     | `NDKPrivateKeySigner` (`auth.ts:158`)                                |
| NIP-49 ncryptsec | `nostr-tools` `nip49.decrypt` → raw key (`auth.ts:9`, `auth.ts:102`) |

### Signer-package findings (verified from package tarballs and live npm, 2026-09-01)

- `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk` (repo pins `3.0.3`, published 2026-02-23) is stale (~6 months
  for the pinned core release) and carries `shiki` and `@codesandbox/sandpack-client`
  as runtime dependencies. `nostr-tools` is a peer dependency of NDK, so removing NDK
  does not remove `nostr-tools`.
- `nostr-tools` is very active (latest 2.25.1, published 2026-08-30; ~2.65M
  downloads/week) and is already the shared event layer (repo pins `^2.23.3`).
- `applesauce-signers` (the package name — `@applesauce/signers` does not exist) at
  6.2.2 (2026-07-01, hzrd149) provides an audited class for every current login
  path — a prerequisite for migration, not a claim of drop-in equivalence:
  `NostrConnectSigner` (NIP-46; persists the session via instance `getNbunksec()`
  and restores it via static `fromNbunksec()`, with static
  `createNbunksec()`/`parseNbunksec()` utilities), `ExtensionSigner` (NIP-07,
  `window.nostr` proxy), `PrivateKeySigner` (raw key), `PasswordSigner` (NIP-49,
  `fromNcryptsec` + `unlock`/`lock`), plus `AmberClipboardSigner`, `ReadOnlySigner`,
  and `SerialPortSigner`. An `AndroidNativeSigner` exists but is deliberately **not
  exported** and requires the optional `nostr-signer-capacitor-plugin`.
- Cashu libraries **cannot sign nostr events**: `@cashu/coco-core` 2.0.0 (which depends
  on `@cashu/cashu-ts` 5.0.0-rc.4) and current `@cashu/cashu-ts` (latest 4.10.0) have
  zero nostr event-signing capability. The NUT-27 hypothesis is disproven for the TS
  libraries. (These are ADR-0010 _target-stack_ versions; the repo currently pins
  `@cashu/cashu-ts ^2.1` and `coco-cashu-core rc11`.)

### Baseline disclosure: this ADR's baseline is `master`, not PR #1199

An earlier draft of this ADR described the current state from open PR #1199
(`fix/remote-signer-login`) and cited its three NDK-internal workarounds — the `_user`
cache poke, the rpc listener strip, and the `userPubkey` clear-restore — as motivation.
**None of those three hacks exist on `master`; they are #1199-only.** Per review, this
ADR takes current `master` as its only baseline: none of the features or functionality
in #1199 are used within this ADR, and Wave A3b supersedes #1199 outright (see
"Sequencing"). #1199 is treated only as a source of regression cases. It is expected
to be closed, not merged.

### Current-state facts (all verified on `master`)

- `src/lib/nostr/io-applesauce.ts` `sign()` deliberately throws — "not wired until Wave
  A3". The io seam's `sign()` port (`src/lib/nostr/io.ts`) is the intended wiring point.
- `src/lib/nostr/nip59.ts` depends on NDK's extended `NDKSigner` interface. The
  `*WithSigner` paths gate on capability first — `assertSignerSupportsNip44`
  (`nip59.ts:255`, checking `encryptionEnabled`/`encrypt`/`decrypt` and failing
  closed when absent) — then delegate crypto to the signer: `signerPubkeyFor`
  (`:265`), `encryptForRecipientWithSigner` (`:272`, `signer.encrypt(…, 'nip44')`),
  `decryptFromSenderWithSigner` (`:285`, `signer.decrypt(…, 'nip44')`), and
  `signEventWithSigner` (`:301`, `signer.sign(…)`). These call sites are the exact
  surface the signer capability seam must replace (see "Invariants").
- `src/components/auth/NostrConnectQR.tsx` creates a throwaway
  `NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate()` for the NIP-46 handshake, and builds
  `nostrconnect://` URIs with a **non-spec `token` query param** (`:119`, matched at
  `:252`) where NIP-46 specifies `secret`.
- The NIP-46 local session key is persisted **unencrypted**:
  `localStorage.setItem(NOSTR_LOCAL_SIGNER_KEY, …)` at `auth.ts:266` (read at `:62`),
  alongside `nostr_connect_url` (`auth.ts:12`). Open security issue #996 (finding H8)
  tracks this.
- NIP-46 remote login is broken on `master` for real bunker signers (open issue #807,
  "Primal remote login", open since 2026-04-14); the non-spec `token` URI above is a
  contributing cause. Master's QR flow has a 5-minute UI timeout and no
  handshake-budget/recovery logic.
- Coverage on `master`: **16 e2e specs** in `e2e/tests/auth.spec.ts` plus **1** mock
  unit test (`src/lib/__tests__/nip46-mock.test.ts`). There are **zero** unit tests of
  `authActions`. (`src/lib/__tests__/auth-nip46.test.ts` — the 11/19 NIP-46 unit tests —
  does not exist on `master`; it exists only on unmerged #1199.)
- The e2e NIP-46 mock uses a single keypair for remote-signer and user
  (`new Nip46Mock(devUser2.sk)`), so `master`'s green e2e cannot detect
  remote-signer/user identity collapse.
- `authStore` state is typed `user: NDKUser | null`; 18 files under `src/` import or
  reference `NDKUser`.
- Server-side `src/server/EventSigner.ts` is already NDK-free at runtime (pure
  `nostr-tools` `finalizeEvent`) and is unaffected by this ADR.

## Decision

Adopt `applesauce-signers` ≥ 6.2 as the app's signer package. The unified target stack
is `@cashu/coco-core` (Cashu) + `applesauce-signers` (nostr signing) + `nostr-tools`
(shared `nip19`/`nip44`/`finalizeEvent` layer). NDK drops entirely.

Unification is **not** via Cashu: since Cashu libraries cannot sign nostr events, the
signer seat belongs to `applesauce-signers` and the wallet seat to `coco-core`, with
`nostr-tools` shared underneath both.

### Locked decisions

- `applesauce-signers` ≥ 6.2 (6.2.2 audited). Prerequisite met: `applesauce-core`
  `^6.2.0` / `applesauce-relay` `^6.2.0` landed on `master` via PR #1253 (merged
  2026-09-01); `applesauce-signers` 6.2.2 itself depends on `applesauce-core ^6.2.0`.
- `nostr-tools` is retained as the shared event/nip19/nip44 layer. It is not replaced
  by this ADR; `applesauce-signers` interoperates with raw `nostr-tools` events.
- **Migration contract (per review):** validate the current `master` implementation
  as e2e tests first — guaranteeing a working current version and surfacing any flaws —
  then migrate keeping all the tests working. What is ported is the _invariants_, not
  PR #1199: characterize current behavior, establish protocol-faithful executable
  invariants, and preserve those invariants through Waves A3/A3b. None of #1199's
  features or functionality are used.
- No NDK-internal workaround is ported, of any kind. The three hacks cited in the
  earlier draft are #1199-only and die with #1199.
- The coverage baseline is `master`'s: 16 e2e specs + 1 mock unit test. Coverage must
  not regress below it, and the e2e NIP-46 mock is upgraded to distinct
  remote-signer/user keypairs so identity-collapse regressions are detectable.
- NIP-46 recovery semantics (reconnect, unreachable bunker, session resume) must be
  re-tested against `NostrConnectSigner`; NDK-era recovery behavior is not assumed to
  carry over. Neither library imposes default request timeouts — handshake/recovery
  budgets are app-level code and are rebuilt at A3b, not inherited.

### Signer registry and `src/AGENTS.md` reconciliation

All `applesauce-signers` imports live behind a **signer registry inside
`src/lib/nostr/`**. `src/lib/stores/auth.ts` and UI components do not import
`applesauce-signers` directly.

The literal rule in `src/AGENTS.md` reads: "no new `@nostr-dev-kit` or `applesauce-*`
imports; route all Nostr relay I/O through `src/lib/nostr/io.ts`." Read literally, this
prohibits _any_ new `applesauce-*` import — including `applesauce-signers`. This ADR
reconciles that conflict explicitly rather than asserting a parallel interpretation:

- The existing carve-out is only about **relay I/O**. ADR-0002's exception covers
  `applesauce-core` / `applesauce-relay` _behind_ `src/lib/nostr/io.ts`; on its face it
  does not name the signer seat, and this ADR does not stretch it to.
- **This ADR sanctions the signer seat as a second, equally narrow exception:** new
  `applesauce-signers` imports are permitted **only** inside the signer registry in
  `src/lib/nostr/`, exactly as relay I/O is confined to the io seam. No `applesauce-*`
  import escapes `src/lib/nostr/` into stores or UI components.
- Because an architectural change must be reflected in the relevant AGENTS.md
  (ADR-0001), **Wave A3/A3b amends `src/AGENTS.md`** to add a one-line signer-seat
  clause beside the existing ADR-0002 clause, explicitly naming `applesauce-signers` as
  authorized within the `src/lib/nostr/` registry. Until that amendment lands, the
  registry is the single sanctioned home and this ADR is the authority for the
  exception.

`NostrConnectSigner` requires app-injected `subscriptionMethod`/`publishMethod`
(transport). These route through the app's **io seam** — the `applesauce-relay` pool
behind `src/lib/nostr/io.ts` — not NDK's internal pool. This is the migration's largest
NDK-visible behavioral difference and is Wave A3b's core wiring task.

### Login path mapping

| Login path       | Current (NDK, `master`)                   | Target (applesauce-signers)                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| NIP-46 bunker    | `NDKNip46Signer` (`auth.ts:250`)          | `NostrConnectSigner`                                |
| NIP-07 extension | `NDKNip07Signer` (`auth.ts:208`)          | `ExtensionSigner`                                   |
| nsec raw key     | `NDKPrivateKeySigner` (`auth.ts:158`)     | `PrivateKeySigner`                                  |
| NIP-49 ncryptsec | `nip49.decrypt` → raw key (`auth.ts:102`) | `PasswordSigner` (`fromNcryptsec`, `unlock`/`lock`) |

`NostrConnectQR.tsx`'s throwaway key moves from `NDKPrivateKeySigner.generate()` to
`PrivateKeySigner.generate()`.

`PasswordSigner` becomes the NIP-49 model: the ncryptsec stays encrypted at rest, the
signer holds the passphrase-derived key only between `unlock()` and `lock()`, and the
app never materializes a persistent raw key for NIP-49 users.

### Hidden surfaces the migration must enumerate

1. **`NDKUser` decoupling.** `authStore`'s state is typed `user: NDKUser | null` and 18
   files under `src/` import or reference `NDKUser`. Applesauce signers have no
   `user()` method — the identity model moves to raw pubkeys and the io seam's
   `NostrUser`. Wave A3 must plan for this surface rather than discover it.
2. **Persisted-session compatibility.** Existing users' `nostr_local_signer_key` +
   `nostr_connect_url` (plaintext client key, session-resume path `auth.ts:66`) follow
   the persisted-session migration policy in "Invariants": migrate to encrypted-at-rest
   nbunksec storage via `NostrConnectSigner.fromNbunksec()`, or trigger an intentional,
   documented forced re-login. A forced re-login is a named decision, not an accident of
   the migration.
3. **`nip59` `WithSigner` paths.** `nip59.ts`'s signer-delegating helpers
   (`nip59.ts:255`, `:265`, `:272`, `:285`, `:301`) currently bind to NDK's extended
   `NDKSigner`. These are replaced by the app-owned signer capability seam in
   "Invariants": NIP-59 checks `getPublicKey` / `signEvent` / `nip44` capability and
   fails closed if absent, so NIP-07 users (no key exposure) and NIP-46 users (delegated
   crypto) share one boundary. No signer path falls back to local `nostr-tools` NIP-44
   behind a user who never exposed a key.

### Session persistence and security

`NostrConnectSigner` persists NIP-46 sessions as nbunksec strings (`getNbunksec()`).
**nbunksec is an encoding, not encryption** — anyone with the stored string can resume
the session (the client private key is in the clear).

Wave A3b therefore **requires encryption at rest** for the NIP-46 client secret /
nbunksec, matching open issue #996 (finding H8), whose prescribed fix is encryption at
rest. Plaintext persistence is permissible only as a **named maintainer risk-acceptance
recorded against #996** — not as an open-ended option. Encrypted session keys are the
intended security improvement over the status quo (`auth.ts:266` stores the raw key
today). Note #996 H8 also covers NWC wallet secrets, which this ADR does not touch.

### Sequencing

- **Wave A3 — NIP-07 + nsec.** Swap `NDKNip07Signer` → `ExtensionSigner` and
  `NDKPrivateKeySigner` → `PrivateKeySigner` via the signer registry, wire `sign()` in
  `io-applesauce.ts`, and move `src/lib/nostr/nip59.ts` off NDK's extended `NDKSigner`
  interface onto the signer capability seam: local-key signers implement `nip44` locally,
  while the remote-delegation path for NIP-46 users (still on the old lane in this wave)
  delegates through the same seam. Each path's current behavior is characterized, its
  executable invariants pinned, then preserved through the swap — no path is treated as
  a drop-in.
- **Wave A3b — NIP-46.** Swap `NDKNip46Signer` → `NostrConnectSigner` (registry +
  io-seam transport), fix the nostrconnect URI to spec (`secret`, not `token`),
  implement encrypted session persistence, keep all e2e specs green, and re-test
  recovery semantics. Wave D (NDK singleton deletion) remains gated on A3b per
  ADR-0002.
- **PR #1199 is superseded by Wave A3b.** #1199 is expected to be closed, not merged;
  none of its machinery is a prerequisite here, and its fix for #807 rides A3b. #807
  (open since 2026-04-14) is why A3b must be _scheduled_, not left open-ended: with
  NIP-46 on `master` broken for real bunker signers, A3b is the wave that deletes and
  replaces the broken handshake path.
- **Implementation timing: P2, after auctions** (maintainer direction, 2026-09-01).
  This ADR is a text-only decision record and does not advance implementation.

### Security test plan for Wave A3b

Wave A3b implements — and these negative tests prove — the invariants above:

1. **Connect-secret/ack validation.** A client-initiated `nostrconnect://` handshake
   must not bind an unknown remote signer on a bare `ack`; the expected connect secret
   (the `connectSecret` in the URI) must validate first. Tests cover both wrong secret
   and a bare-`ack` `connect` response, asserting fail-closed (no session persisted).
2. **Remote-signer ≠ user-pubkey.** Unit + e2e regression tests use distinct keypairs
   (`remoteSignerSk ≠ userSk`) — carried by the e2e mock upgrade above — so
   identity-collapse regressions are detectable.
3. **Signed-event identity invariant.** Every remote response event is
   signature-verified, and a returned signed event must satisfy
   `event.pubkey === authenticatedUserPubkey`; a valid signature from the _wrong_ user
   key fails closed (a dedicated negative test).
4. **nostrconnect URI conformance.** `secret` (the `connectSecret` query param), not the
   non-spec `token` — the #807/Primal compatibility fix.

### Bus factor

`hzrd149` is the sole maintainer of all applesauce packages. This is an accepted risk,
consistent with ADR-0002's implicit acceptance for relay I/O. Mitigations: the signer
surface is small and MIT-licensed, `nostr-tools` remains the shared event layer as an
escape hatch, and the package is in active use across the applesauce ecosystem.

## Invariants

These are the executable properties the migration must preserve or newly enforce. They
are locked by this ADR — Waves A3/A3b implement them; they are **not** open for
re-adjudication at implementation time.

### NIP-46 trust/identity chain

These hold whether the connection is client-initiated (a `nostrconnect://` URI the app
builds and shows as a QR) or bunker-initiated (`bunker://`).

1. **Connect-secret validation precedes binding.** In a client-initiated
   `nostrconnect://` flow, an unknown remote signer MUST NOT be bound from a bare `ack`.
   The NIP-46 `connect` result is either `"ack"` or the echoed connect secret
   (`applesauce-signers` types it `"ack" | string`); the app verifies the expected
   connect secret (the `connectSecret` the app generates — settable on the signer
   as the `signer.connectSecret` instance property, defaulting to random — and
   publishes in the `nostrconnect://` URI; the bunker echoes it back and the app
   verifies the match; the older `secret` field is a deprecated alias for
   `connectSecret`)
   before treating the remote signer as the authenticated peer. A generic `ack` — or any
   secret mismatch — fails closed and does not persist a session.
2. **Remote-signer pubkey ≠ authenticated user pubkey.** The remote-signer pubkey (the
   relayed NIP-46 provider that signs on the user's behalf) stays strictly separate from
   the authenticated user pubkey learned via `get_public_key` / `getPublicKey()`. Identity
   resolution uses only the `get_public_key` result.
3. **Signed-event identity invariant.** An event returned from `sign_event` /
   `signEvent()` MUST satisfy `event.pubkey === authenticatedUserPubkey` and carry a
   cryptographically valid signature. A structurally valid signature produced by a
   _different_ key — or a returned event whose `pubkey` differs from the resolved user
   identity — fails closed. `applesauce-signers` returns a `VerifiedEvent` from
   `signEvent()` (verified in-signer); the app still asserts the pubkey identity match,
   because in-signer verification alone does not prove _which_ key signed.
4. **Persisted-session migration policy.** The current NIP-46 flow persists the plaintext
   client key (`localStorage.setItem(NOSTR_LOCAL_SIGNER_KEY, …)` at `auth.ts:266`, read
   at `auth.ts:62` and passed to `loginWithNip46` at `auth.ts:66`). Migration MUST either
   (a) migrate existing persisted sessions to encrypted-at-rest nbunksec storage via
   `NostrConnectSigner.fromNbunksec()`, or (b) trigger an intentional, user-visible forced
   re-login. Retaining plaintext bearer-capability storage is permitted only as a named
   maintainer risk-acceptance explicitly recorded against issue #996 (finding H8) — never
   as a silent default.
5. **Negative coverage.** Wave A3b adds tests asserting each failure path closes safely:
   wrong connect secret, a `connect` response that is a bare `ack` in the client-initiated
   flow, remote-signer/user identity separation (distinct keypairs), and a valid signature
   produced by the wrong user key. These are regression tests, not optional.

### Signer capability seam

One app-owned capability boundary covers all signer types — NIP-07, NIP-46, and local.
Conceptually it is `getPublicKey`, `signEvent`, and optional `nip44.encrypt` /
`nip44.decrypt`; this matches `applesauce-signers`' `ISigner` interface (`getPublicKey`,
`signEvent`, plus optional `nip44` / `nip04` maps). The seam exists so no code path relies
on a signer implementation that either exposes the user's private key or silently lacks a
crypto primitive:

- **Local signers** (`PrivateKeySigner`, `PasswordSigner`) implement `nip44` locally —
  their `nip44` is non-optional.
- **Delegating signers differ.** `NostrConnectSigner` (NIP-46) delegates
  `nip04`/`nip44` over NIP-46 RPC (`nip44_encrypt`/`nip44_decrypt`) and always
  exposes them. `ExtensionSigner` (NIP-07) exposes `nip44` only when
  `window.nostr.nip44` exists and may legitimately be `undefined`.
- **Consumers fail closed.** An operation that requires NIP-44 (NIP-59 gift-wrap
  seal/encrypt/decrypt) checks the capability first and throws/rejects if absent. A NIP-07
  user may authenticate without Plebeian ever seeing their private key, so NIP-59 cannot
  fall back to local `nostr-tools` NIP-44 for that path — the capability check is the only
  safe gate. `nip59.ts`'s existing `assertSignerSupportsNip44` (`nip59.ts:255`) already
  fails closed this way; the seam generalizes that check to `getPublicKey` / `signEvent` /
  `nip44` across all signer types.

## Consequences

Positive:

- All four login paths map onto audited `applesauce-signers` classes; no custom signer
  code. Parity per path is established and preserved through the invariants above, not
  assumed.
- NDK drops entirely (Wave D unblocked), removing a stale dependency and its
  `shiki`/`sandpack-client` baggage.
- NIP-49 users gain a proper unlock/lock model instead of a decrypted raw key.
- Persisted NIP-46 session keys gain mandatory encryption at rest (#996 H8).
- The `token` → `secret` nostrconnect URI fix lands together with the #807 fix.
- The baseline is honest: `master`'s actual coverage (16 e2e specs + 1 mock test) is
  the contract, and the single-keypair mock blind spot is fixed.
- The e2e-first migration contract guarantees a working current version before any
  signer swap.

Negative / tradeoffs:

- Bus factor of one on the applesauce ecosystem (accepted, see above).
- The e2e-first characterization pass is real work before any signer swap.
- NIP-46 recovery semantics must be re-validated, not assumed (no library-level
  timeouts; app-level budgets are rebuilt at A3b).
- The session-key encryption mechanism is decided at Wave A3b; this ADR mandates the
  encryption requirement, not the mechanism.
- `NDKUser` decoupling touches the 18-file identity surface during Wave A3.
- #807 stays open until A3b lands (implementation is P2, after auctions).

## Implementation status notes

Updated 2026-09-06 as Wave B-3 (encrypted session persistence, #996 H8) lands on PR #1252:

- **Session vault** (`src/lib/nostr/session-vault.ts`): the nbunksec NIP-46
  session payload is wrapped PBKDF2-SHA256 (≥600k iterations) → AES-GCM-256
  (envelope `{v,kdf,iterations,salt,iv,ct}`, base64) and stored under
  localStorage key `nostr_session_v1`. `migrateLegacySessionToVault` wraps the
  legacy plaintext pair then deletes it (read-ONCE migration); refusal
  (`discardLegacySession`) writes no vault and logs the user out — invariant 4b.
- **Auth store** (`src/lib/stores/auth.ts`): `loginWithNip46` persists the
  vault ONLY when a `sessionPassphrase` is supplied (otherwise in-memory
  session; the plaintext pair is never written again). The boot gate surfaces
  `needsSessionUnlock` instead of silently re-logging-in with plaintext.
  `unlockVaultedSession` rehydrates a `NostrConnectSigner` from the unwrapped
  nbunksec (via `src/lib/nostr/nostr-connect-session.ts`, wrapped in the B-2
  capability); `discardVaultedSession` is the refusal path; `logout` clears
  the vault (lock-on-logout).
- **UI**: `SessionUnlockDialog` (`src/components/auth/SessionUnlockDialog.tsx`,
  mounted in `src/routes/__root.tsx`) drives unlock/discard;
  `BunkerConnect.tsx` gained an optional session-passphrase field passed as
  `sessionPassphrase`.
- **NIP-49 lane** (`decryptAndLogin`): `nostr-tools/nip49.decrypt` was
  replaced by `createPasswordSignerSession` (`PasswordSigner.fromNcryptsec`)
  from `src/lib/nostr/password-signer-session.ts` — the ncryptsec is decrypted
  inside the signer and every capability call is gated on `signer.unlocked`
  (the library deadlocks on locked calls — signers-api-audit gap 4).
- Unit evidence: `src/lib/__tests__/session-vault.test.ts` (11 tests) and
  `src/lib/__tests__/auth-session-vault.test.ts` (12 tests) cover round-trip,
  tamper/fail-closed, legacy migration, refuse-migration-logout, persistence
  gating, and the locked-deadlock guard.
