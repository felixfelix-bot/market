# ADR-0009: Test-Listing Curation via NIP-32 Labels

## Status

Accepted (rev 6 — browsing-only gating + inspectability toggle + the discovery/curation surface taxonomy + spec-validity admission as the taxonomy's second rule; products on `master`, auctions on `auctions` — both implemented)

## Date

2026-08-20

## Context

The marketplace has a persistent curation need: test items are posted as
products today and appear on the Plebeian Market front page alongside real
listings. This is expected — people continuously test tools and user
experience — but test items should not appear in official feeds.

The same need applies to auctions: as the feature rolls out, auctions that
are just beta tests will be posted while people familiarize themselves with
the new feature, and official auction feeds will be curated at our
discretion during the launch phase.

The mechanism should be:

- **Reusable** — one mechanism covering products and auctions, wherever
  browsing and discovery surfaces are rendered.
- **Flexible** — applicable at our discretion, before, during, or after any
  launch phase, without schema changes.
- **Implementation-independent** — a Nostr-native signal any client or
  service can consume, not an application-internal flag.

## Decision

Use **NIP-32 labeling events** (kind 1985) to tag items as tests.

- Label event: kind 1985 with tags `["L", "com.plebeian.market"]`,
  `["l", "test", "com.plebeian.market"]`, and an `a`-tag holding the target
  item coordinate (product or auction). The `.content` field carries the
  reason and a **contact reference** — an npub or nip05 the labeled item's
  author can reach if they believe the label was applied in error.
- **Authorized labelers only** — labels count only when signed by keys the
  app authorizes. The authorized set is the app's **editors union its
  admins** (plus the app owner): editors are the day-to-day curation role
  and admins are curated content authorities, so both may curate. A
  dedicated moderator role or an automated labeler can be enrolled later
  without protocol change.
- **Scope: products and auctions only.** Labels attach to item coordinates,
  never to users. A valid, active user may post test items; the user's
  presence (shop, products, community) is unaffected while the item is
  curated. Whole-pubkey hiding remains the job of the existing spam
  blacklist and is explicitly out of scope here.
- **Browsing-only gating** — a test label hides an item from browsing and
  discovery surfaces only (home feed, paginated browse, search, collections,
  auction feed). The item remains reachable via direct link, the seller's
  profile, and the owner's dashboard.
- **Discovery vs curation surfaces (rev 4)** — filtering is a property of
  _organic discovery_ surfaces, not of every surface that happens to render an
  item. A **discovery surface** answers "what is for sale?" using selection
  criteria the viewer did not choose: home feed, paginated browse, NIP-50
  search _including its seller-name expansion_, collections, and the auction
  feed. A **curation surface** shows what a human explicitly chose: the
  app-configured Featured sections (products, collections, users) and, later,
  CMS-authored pages and blocks. Curation surfaces are **ungated by default** —
  the curator sees exactly what they picked. Opting a curation block into
  filtering is a per-block configuration decision reserved for the CMS work,
  never an ambient default. The label mechanism itself remains available on
  every surface; what this taxonomy fixes is the _default_, so a stale or
  accidental label can never silently empty a surface an operator believes they
  control.
- **The taxonomy is about filtering, not about labels (rev 6)** — a second,
  independent rule now follows the same split: **spec-validity admission**
  (an event that fails its kind's parser is not an item) is gated on discovery
  surfaces, kept reachable by direct link with a notice naming the reason, and
  ungated on owner/curation surfaces. See _Spec validity — the taxonomy applied
  to the event format_ below. Anything that can hide an item from a surface
  follows this shape; the label is its first instance, not its definition.

### Label event example

```json
{
	"kind": 1985,
	"pubkey": "<authorized-labeler-pubkey>",
	"created_at": 1724178700,
	"tags": [
		["L", "com.plebeian.market"],
		["l", "test", "com.plebeian.market"],
		["a", "30402:<merchant-pubkey>:<product-d-tag>"]
	],
	"content": "Marked as test listing. If this is a real product, contact npub1… or nip05:… to request removal."
}
```

The `a`-tag is the sole label target (per NIP-32, target tags represent the
object being labeled). No `p`-tag is included: a `p`-tag would label the
user, which this mechanism explicitly excludes — the merchant's pubkey is
already embedded in the `a`-tag coordinate.

For auctions the `a`-tag coordinate uses the auction kind instead
(e.g. `"<auction-kind>:<pubkey>:<auction-d-tag>"`).

### Un-labeling (deletion) event example

Un-labeling is a **NIP-09 deletion event** signed by the same labeler,
referencing the label event's `id` in an `e` tag:

```json
{
	"kind": 5,
	"pubkey": "<authorized-labeler-pubkey>",
	"created_at": 1724178900,
	"tags": [
		["e", "<label-event-id>"],
		["k", "1985"]
	],
	"content": "Unmarking test label — confirmed as a real product."
}
```

Per NIP-09, the `e`-tag references the specific label event by id, and the
`k`-tag declares the kind being deleted (`1985`). No `a`-tag is used: NIP-09
`a`-tags target replaceable/addressable events, and kind 1985 label events
are not replaceable (NIP-32 explicitly rejects a `d`-tag for this reason).
Clients MUST validate that the deletion event's pubkey matches the label
event's pubkey before treating the label as deleted. Once a valid deletion
is seen, the item reappears in browsing feeds without further action (it
was never hidden from direct-link, profile, or dashboard views).

### Why NIP-32 labels, not NIP-51 blacklists

- **No static list maintenance** — labels are ordinary events, fetched on a
  per-product or per-auction basis. No client- or server-owned list to keep
  in sync, replace atomically, or rebuild on every change.
- **Per-item granularity** — a label targets exactly one item coordinate;
  removing it restores exactly that item. NIP-51 lists are coarse sets with
  replace-event semantics.
- **Auditable** — every label is a signed, timestamped event with an author
  and a reason.

## Implementation

The label check runs in the query layer **alongside the existing delete and
blacklist checks, before queries return data**:

1. When listing products/auctions on browsing and discovery read paths —
   home feed, paginated browse, search (NIP-50), collections, and the
   auction feed — after delete-status and blacklist filtering, check each
   item coordinate for an active `test` label.
2. Labels are fetched per coordinate (kind 1985 filtered by `#a`); feeds
   batch the check for the page's items.
3. Items carrying an authorized `test` label are excluded from browsing and
   discovery feeds only. Detail-by-id, detail-by-a-tag, and by-pubkey
   (seller profile / owner dashboard) read paths return the item regardless
   of label — the label never removes the item from direct navigation.
4. **A discovery surface that composes an ungated read re-applies the gate on
   its own result set.** The gate belongs to the _surface_, not to the read
   path it borrows. Search is the worked example: its seller-name expansion
   fetches each matching seller's catalogue through the by-pubkey read (which
   must stay ungated, per step 3), so search gates the merged result set —
   otherwise a labeled item whose seller name matches would still surface and
   the promise made to the viewer and to the labeler ("hidden from browsing,
   search and collections") would be false for that path.
5. **Curation surfaces are ungated, by decision — not by omission.** The
   app-configured Featured sections resolve items through the by-a-tag detail
   read, so a labeled item an operator has featured stays visible in the
   carousel. This is the rev 4 taxonomy default: a curated surface shows what
   it was told to show, and the operator is not overridden by an ambient
   filter. Recording it here is the point — the gap is a documented decision
   rather than a fix waiting to be noticed. Whether a CMS block can opt _into_
   filtering is deferred to a follow-up proposal covering the taxonomy's
   naming, per-surface defaults, and block-level configuration.
6. Un-labeling is a NIP-09 deletion event (kind 5) signed by the same
   labeler, referencing the original label event's `id` in an `e` tag with
   a `k`-tag of `1985`. Clients MUST validate that the deletion event's
   pubkey matches the label event's pubkey before treating the label as
   deleted. The query layer treats a deleted label as absent — the item
   reappears without further action.
7. The label check runs only on browsing/discovery read paths, so a freshly
   un-labeled item reappears in those feeds without further action (it was
   never hidden from direct-link, profile, or dashboard views).

### UI

Dashboard / moderation actions for authorized labelers (editors ∪ admins):

- **Mark as "Test" Product** — publishes the kind 1985 label event.
  Reachable from the product's own dashboard edit page and, so a labeler can
  curate a listing they do not own, from the product's public page via the
  entity actions menu. The `.content` is pre-filled with a contact reference
  (the labeler's npub or a shared moderation nip05) so the item author can
  appeal.
- **Unmark as "Test" Product** — publishes the NIP-09 deletion event for
  the existing label. Visible only when an active `test` label is present
  on the item. Confirm dialog before publishing.

Both actions provide immediate UI feedback (optimistic state update),
then reconcile with the relay round-trip. Non-authorized users never see
these controls.

A **"Show test listings"** toggle is available to all users (admins and
regular users alike) on the browsing surface. It defaults to **hidden**
(labeled items are filtered out of browsing feeds); turning it on reveals
test-labeled items in those feeds. The toggle only affects
browsing/discovery read paths — direct links, seller profiles, and owner
dashboards always show the item.

Because gating is browsing-only, a labeled item stays visible on surfaces
where the viewer has no way to know it is curated — a direct link, the
seller's profile, the owner's dashboard. Every such surface therefore carries
a **user-facing notice** (`TestListingNotice`):

- **Detail page** — an amber "Test listing" pill beside the stock badge, next
  to the entity actions menu. Clicking it opens the explainer dialog.
- **Seller profile, owner dashboard, and toggle-revealed cards** — the same
  component in its compact icon-only variant (an eye-with-slash marker). On
  cards the marker must not trigger the surrounding link's navigation.
- **Explainer dialog** — states the exact effect (hidden from browsing and
  discovery, reachable by direct link) and gives an appeal path: the labeler's
  npub, falling back to the Plebeian team when the labeler is unknown.

**Copy invariant:** the mark/unmark confirmation dialogs MUST describe the
browsing-only effect. An earlier revision claimed the item was "excluded from
feeds and detail views", which is wrong — detail views are never gated — and
misled the labeler about what the action does.

### Auctions — surface map (implemented on the `auctions` branch)

The same taxonomy, resolved against the auction reads. The distinction that
matters in code is **where** the gate is applied, not only where it is skipped:

- **Gated (discovery):** the auction feed — `fetchAuctions` in
  `src/queries/auctions.tsx`. It runs blacklist → local deletes → the label
  check → version collapse, so every version of a labeled coordinate drops
  together and no older version can resurrect the auction in the feed.
- **Ungated, by decision:** `fetchAuction` (detail by id — the direct-link
  promise), `fetchAuctionByATag` (detail by a-tag), `fetchAuctionsByPubkey`
  (seller profile and owner dashboard). **The gate is never applied inside
  `fetchAuctionVersionEvents`**, the shared version-resolution helper all three
  of those reads go through: filtering there would collapse a labeled auction's
  version set to nothing and leave the item reachable only through the
  by-a-tag fallback path. Step 3 is a property of the read, not of a hopeful
  fallback. The Featured carousel (`auctionByATagQueryOptions`) inherits the
  same ungated read, which is the rev 4 curation default working as intended.
- **UI:** the `Show test listings` toggle sits beside the auction filters on
  the feed; the compact card marker renders top-left on `AuctionCard` (the
  top-right corner carries the LIVE/ENDED badge); the detail-page pill sits
  under the auction title row; and the mark/unmark action reaches the public
  auction page and the owner dashboard directly through `TestLabelButton` —
  auctions have no `EntityActionsMenu`, whose test-label arm is
  product-scoped, so the shared button _is_ the auctions equivalent of the
  product page's entity actions menu. The owner's dashboard detail carries the
  same notice as the product one.

Coverage:

- `src/queries/__tests__/auctionTestLabelGate.test.ts` — the feed gate (a
  labeled coordinate drops as a whole, versions included), the toggle
  revealed _and_ re-hidden, the fail-open invariant (no load at all, and the
  optimistic window where a coordinate is labeled but no load has completed),
  and the detail reads: by-id / by-a-tag / by-pubkey still return a labeled
  auction and issue no label query — asserted on
  `ndkActions.fetchEventsWithTimeout`, the port label reads actually use, with
  authorization determinable so the absence means something. What that file does
  _not_ establish: label authorization and NIP-09 reconciliation — those rest on
  `testLabels.test.ts` (pure primitives) and on the e2e family below.
- `e2e/tests/test-labels-auctions.spec.ts` — feed exclusion, direct link with
  the notice and explainer (and the unlabeled control rendering without one),
  toggle reveal with the card marker and re-hide, NIP-09 reappearance, a NIP-09
  deletion from a _different_ key not un-hiding the item, unauthorized label
  ignored, authorized labeler curating another seller's auction from its public
  page, owner dashboard keeping the item, non-authorized user seeing no actions
  on the public page or on the dashboard list.

Gate: that e2e family is locked into the per-PR `e2e-grep` alternation
(`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`, `|Test listing labels — auctions`), so the feed
exclusion is exercised on every pull request instead of only in the scheduled
`e2e-full` job.
`src/lib/__tests__/e2e-workflow-gate-membership.test.ts` fails if a describe in
the spec stops matching the gate pattern, the same guard the `OG Meta Tags`
family carries.

### Spec validity — the taxonomy applied to the event format (rev 6)

Rev 4 named the surface split; rev 6 records that it is a rule about **gating in
general**, and adds the two obligations a gate carries. The worked example is
kind-30408 (auctions), where the label mechanism and spec-validity admission sit
side by side on the same reads.

**Why a second rule.** A test label answers "should this real item be shown?".
Spec validity answers a prior question: "is this an item at all?". An event that
fails the kind's parser (missing required tags, a tag value outside its range)
is not an auction, and before this revision it was still rendered — it took a
card slot in the feed and, because a missing close time read as `0`, it took
slot #1 under the default "Ending Soon" sort and rendered "No end date". The
gate for it cannot be a label: nobody has to curate it away, and the parser is
already the definition of the rule.

**The rule, stated once.** An event is admissible when the repository's own
parser for its kind accepts it. `src/lib/schemas/auction/auctionAdmission.ts`
holds no second required-tag list: it calls `parseAuctionEvent` and translates
the structured failure into tag-scoped reasons. If the parser learns a
constraint, every gate and every notice learns it in the same commit — the
alternative is the drift that produced the original defect.

**Where the gate is applied (auctions).**

- **Gated (discovery):** `fetchAuctions` (the auction feed; applied to the
  collapsed version set, so the decision is about the version the feed would
  render) and `fetchAuctionsByPubkey` in its default `browsing` scope (seller
  profile, "more from seller"). Query keys are scoped
  (`auctionKeys.byPubkey(pubkey, 'browsing' | 'owner')`) so the two rules cannot
  share a cache entry.
- **Ungated, by decision:** `fetchAuction` (detail by id), `fetchAuctionByATag`
  (detail by a-tag) — the direct-link promise — plus the owner dashboard list,
  its detail page and the notification-routing read, which pass
  `{ includeInvalid: true }`: a seller cannot republish a corrected event they
  cannot see. The Featured carousel inherits the same ungated by-a-tag read
  (rev 4 curation default).
- **UI:** `InvalidAuctionNotice` renders on the public detail page and the
  owner's dashboard detail page, naming the offending tags
  (`missing the required tag \`start_at\``) rather than saying "invalid". It
reads the same `inspectAuctionAdmission` the gate reads, so the badge can never
  disagree with the reason the auction is absent from the feed.

**A gated item is not interactive.** Reachability by direct link is for
_inspection_, not for participation. A malformed auction keeps its notice and
loses its bid panel (`AuctionBidder` renders `InvalidAuctionBidBlock`): a bid
would lock the bidder's eCash to a seller-derived P2PK key at the mint against an
event the validators refuse, and the funds stay locked until the locktime.
Every number the bid path checks (window, floor, increment) is derived from the
same tags the parser could not read, so the panel would be showing guesses.
The same principle applies to any future admission rule: gate the read _and_
close the write.

**Owner surfaces opt out of the gate, never of the notice.** The dashboard keeps
the event visible with the notice attached, which is what makes the correction
path (republish the addressable event) reachable at all.

**Ordering is a separate defect, and stays separate.** A gate does not fix a
comparator: `getAuctionEndingSoonRank` buckets cutoffs into live → unknown →
ended, so a value the parser cannot read never outranks a real auction on the
surfaces that are deliberately ungated. Pinned as pure functions in
`src/lib/__tests__/auctionEndingSoonOrder.test.ts`.

**Scope of rev 6.** The obligations above are written as the general shape for
any admission rule, but only kind-30408 implements one today. Other kinds are
surfaced without an equivalent check — see roadmap item 10. The repository-level
AGENTS.md rule that would make this binding for every kind ("Event validation
before surfacing") is drafted but not landed: AGENTS.md is a protected file and
the write needs the maintainer's explicit approval.

Coverage:

- `src/lib/__tests__/auctionAdmission.test.ts` — the parser as the single source
  of truth (missing tag, zero timing, non-numeric timing, wrong kind, one issue
  per failing tag) and the batch filter.
- `src/queries/__tests__/auctionAdmissionGate.test.ts` — the read boundary:
  feed drops, the version the feed would render is the one judged, the owner
  scope keeps the event, the two scopes cannot share a cache entry, and the
  direct reads stay ungated.
- `e2e/tests/auction-invalid-event-gate.spec.ts` — the relay really holds the
  malformed event, the feed omits it, the ten-minute control still outranks the
  tomorrow control, the direct link renders it with the notice naming the tag,
  the bid panel is replaced by the block, and a well-formed auction renders
  neither.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- The front page shows real listings only — today and permanently.
- Auction beta curation is a discretionary use of the same mechanism: no
  schema change at launch or at go-live; opening up simply means labeling
  fewer things.
- Works regardless of how the item was published (our app, third-party
  clients, direct relay writes).
- No user is ever hidden by this mechanism.
- Spec-validity admission (rev 6) needs no curator: an event that is not an item
  is not shown, and the same predicate answers the detail page's notice, the
  feed's gate and the bid panel's block.

**Negative / trade-offs accepted:**

- Net-new implementation: label schema, authorized-labeler check, and the
  query-layer filter (mirrors existing blacklist plumbing).
- One more check on read paths (batchable for feeds).
- NIP-32 currently has draft/optional status in the NIPs repo.
- **Curated surfaces stay ungated (rev 4), so a labeled item an operator has
  featured remains visible in the Featured carousel.** Accepted deliberately
  over the alternative — a curated surface silently dropping an item a human
  explicitly chose, which would get worse once CMS page authors inherit an
  ambient filter they cannot see. The surface taxonomy and the CMS block-level
  opt-in are a follow-up proposal.
- **Admission inherits the parser's strictness (rev 6).** Tightening a schema is
  now also a decision about what disappears from browsing: the zero-timing ruling
  (`start_at = 0` + `end_at = 0`) reclassified a shape that used to be shown and
  sorted last. That is the intended direction — the parser is the single
  definition of an item — but it means a schema change is a user-visible change
  and has to be reviewed as one (spec + notice copy + gate coverage together).
- **Only one kind implements admission today (rev 6).** Auctions are covered;
  other kinds are still surfaced on the strength of their shape. Recorded as a
  gap to close per kind, not as a precedent that shape-only rendering is fine.

## Roadmap

1. Label schema + authorized-labeler list.
2. Query-layer `test`-label check beside the delete and blacklist checks
   (products on `master`; auctions on the `auctions` branch).
3. Dashboard actions: **Mark as "Test" Product** / **Unmark as "Test"
   Product** by coordinate, with pre-filled contact reference in `.content`.
4. e2e: a labeled item is excluded from browsing feeds but still reachable
   by direct link, seller profile, and dashboard; an un-labeled item
   reappears after the NIP-09 deletion event is processed.
5. "Show test listings" toggle (all users, default hidden) to reveal
   test-labeled items in browsing feeds.
6. Optional automation (e.g. an automated labeler key) for discretionary
   use during launch phases.
7. User-facing notice on labeled items (detail page, profile, dashboard,
   toggle-revealed cards) with an appeal contact.
8. **Discovery/curation surface taxonomy as a first-class concept** — rev 4
   records the default (discovery gated, curation unrestricted); a follow-up
   proposal covers the taxonomy's naming, per-surface defaults, and CMS
   block-level opt-in. Not a change in this PR.
9. Auctions: the same taxonomy applies to the auction feed (discovery) and to
   any curated auction surface, via the shared `testLabelFilters` layer.
   **Implemented** — see _Auctions — surface map_ above.
10. **Spec-validity admission per event kind (rev 6)** — implemented for
    kind-30408 only. The follow-up is a sweep: for every kind the app renders,
    decide whether a parser-backed admission rule belongs on its discovery
    surfaces, then write the parser first and gate with it. A repository-level
    AGENTS.md rule ("Event validation before surfacing") is drafted to make the
    obligation binding for new kinds; it needs maintainer approval, since
    AGENTS.md is a protected file. This item tracks the kinds that do not meet
    the obligation yet.
