/**
 * Server-side product lookup for social preview (og:) meta injection.
 *
 * When a crawler or link-unfurler requests /products/:productId, the server
 * needs the product's kind 30402 event to render og: tags into the initial
 * HTML. This module fetches that event from the app relay (APP_RELAY_URL —
 * the same relay the server already talks to for invoices and publishing, so
 * no new egress destination), verifies its signature, derives preview meta,
 * and caches the result briefly so repeated crawler hits do not re-query.
 *
 * Single relay, short budget: exactly one relay is queried, under a single
 * ~2.5s deadline covering connect + REQ combined, so a slow or unreachable
 * relay can never stall a crawler. There are NO fallback relays — on any
 * failure the lookup returns null and the caller serves the untouched SPA
 * shell (graceful degradation, because this feature is SEO-only and must
 * never break the production app).
 *
 * Aggregate work bound: rotating random product ids could otherwise drive
 * unbounded concurrent server-side relay lookups. A small process-wide
 * concurrency cap (OG_MAX_CONCURRENT_LOOKUPS) bounds how many lookups may be
 * in flight at once; when the cap is saturated a new lookup falls back to
 * the plain shell (null) immediately rather than queueing. Concurrent
 * lookups for the SAME id are coalesced onto a single in-flight relay query
 * and share its result, so a burst of crawler hits on one product never
 * fans out into N identical relay queries.
 *
 * Every entry point here is best-effort: on any failure (relay down, timeout,
 * unknown id, bad signature) it returns null and the caller serves the
 * untouched SPA shell. A crawler-friendly page must never hang or 5xx.
 *
 * SEAM NOTE (ADR-0002): this module performs server-runtime relay I/O via raw
 * nostr-tools. ADR-0002 scopes the io.ts seam to app-first migration and
 * defers server runtime to Wave E; the seam's default adapter (NDK browser
 * singleton) cannot execute under Bun. This mirrors the existing
 * `src/index.tsx` server pattern, adds no NDK/adapter imports, and is flagged
 * for the Wave E io-server adapter.
