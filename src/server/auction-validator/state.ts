/**
 * Validator state — in-memory model the auction-validator daemon keeps
 * to derive kind-30440 verdicts.
 *
 * The validator is a passive Nostr subscriber; it doesn't own
 * authoritative state. The relays + the Cashu mint are the sources of
 * truth. This state is the *derived* view we maintain to decide
 * what verdict to publish next.
 *
 * Process-restart safety: everything here is rebuilt on subscribe.
 * Kind-30440 is parameterised-replaceable (d-tag = `<bidder>:<auction
 * root>:<bid_event_id>`, per-bid addressability — ADR-0003 §4.4.1
 * amendment), so re-emitting an identical verdict is a no-op for relays
 * and clients. Restart re-derives + re-publishes → eventually
 * consistent without a journal. The validator's first-observation
 * `observed_at` is recovered from its own prior kind-30440 verdicts on
 * the relay on startup (`observedAtRecovery.ts`) so restarts after an
 * auction closed no longer re-stamp in-window bids to `late_arrival`.
 *
 * No DB. No persistence. Memory-only.
