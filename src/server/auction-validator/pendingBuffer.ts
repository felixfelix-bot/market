/**
 * Bounded pending-event buffer.
 *
 * The subscriber buffers events that arrive before the state they
 * depend on (a bid before its auction, a path release before its bid,
 * a settlement before its auction) and replays them when that state
 * lands. Those buffers are fed straight from the relay, so the events
 * are attacker-chosen: their keys are attacker-chosen ids that may
 * never resolve.
 *
 * A per-key cap alone does not bound the footprint — an attacker who
 * invents a new unknown auction id per bid gets a fresh per-key budget
 * every time (review 5645059400, finding 1), and the release/settlement
 * buffers previously had no caps at all (finding 3). Three bounds are
 * enforced here, on top of the per-key cap:
 *
 *   - `maxPendingKeys`    — distinct keys retained across the buffer.
 *   - `maxPendingEvents`  — buffered items retained across the buffer.
 *   - `pendingTtlSec`     — a key whose state never arrives is evicted
 *                           outright, measured from FIRST sight of the
 *                           key so a slow trickle of items cannot pin
 *                           it forever.
 *
 * Eviction is fail-closed: a dropped buffered event is simply never
 * replayed, so the validator issues no verdict for it (it never
 * condemns a bid it failed to observe).
