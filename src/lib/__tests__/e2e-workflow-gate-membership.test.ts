/**
 * Guards per-PR gate membership for the gated e2e families in
 * `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`: `OG Meta Tags` and `Test listing labels —
 * auctions`.
 *
 * The `e2e-grep` job runs one single-quoted `--grep` alternation of
 * deterministic test families on every pull request / push; that gate is the
 * only place the `OG Meta Tags` specs are exercised on a PR (the scheduled
 * `e2e-full` job also runs them, but it is not a merge gate). It is the only
 * merge gate for the `Test listing labels — auctions` spec at all.
 *
 * A family that is renamed or added to `e2e/tests/og-meta-tags.spec.ts` or
 * `e2e/tests/test-labels-auctions.spec.ts` without a matching entry in the gate
 * pattern silently drops out of CI. This guard ties the specs and the workflow
 * together: every `test.describe` title in those specs must be matched by the
 * gate pattern, so removing an alternation term (or renaming a describe) fails
 * a unit test instead of quietly narrowing CI coverage.
