/**
 * Applesauce-backed implementation of the {@link NostrIo} port — the

 *
 * Uses `applesauce-relay`'s `RelayPool` for subscribe/fetch/publish. Relays
 * are mirrored from the NDK store for now (temporary coupling that goes away
 * when the NDK singleton is deleted in Wave D).
 *
 * `sign` is intentionally not wired here: it lands in Wave A3 once the
 * signer (NIP-07 / nsec) is migrated off NDK. Until then, callers that need
 * signing keep routing through the NDK bridge (NIP-46 stays there longest).

 * - `reconnect: true` maps to RxJS `retry()` with NO count, i.e. unbounded.
 *   A relay that stays down would retry forever, keeping the subscription
 *   (and its WebSocket reconnect timer) alive with no give-up path.
 * - `resetOnSuccess: true` (5.2's default) must be dropped: v6's `req()`
 *   emits an OPEN message per relay on every resubscribe attempt, which the
 *   retry operator would treat as "success" and re-arm the counter, making
 *   the bound unreachable for a relay that fails right after opening.
