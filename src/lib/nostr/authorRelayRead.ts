/**
 * Bounded author-relay read path (ADR-0002 Wave 1 read topology (F3, proposed: PR #1333)).
 *
 * Pinned reads — the relays the operator named — stay canonical. When a pinned
 * read misses, the four degraded reads named in F3 may consult the relays the
 * author declared in their own kind-10002 list, inside an explicit bound:
 *
 * - **per read**: the declared list is untrusted input. Declarations are
 *   deduplicated, scheme-filtered (plain `ws`/`wss` only — no `.onion`, no
 *   non-WebSocket scheme, no embedded credentials), restricted to read-capable
 *   entries, and hard-capped at {@link MAX_AUTHOR_RELAYS_PER_READ} relays.
 * - **per relay**: a timeout ({@link AUTHOR_RELAY_TIMEOUT_MS} by default). The
 *   kind-10002 declaration read is bounded by the same deadline, so a
 *   declaration read that never settles cannot keep a run alive indefinitely.
 * - **serial**: relays are contacted one at a time, never in parallel, so a
 *   read cannot fan out and cannot keep more than one author-relay connection
 *   open at a time.
 * - **per session**: a cap on the number of distinct author relays admitted
 *   during a session, with TTL + eviction
 *   ({@link MAX_DISTINCT_AUTHOR_RELAYS_PER_SESSION}), so N distinct authors
 *   cannot accumulate an unbounded relay pool. Cached read results expire on the
 *   same TTL pass, so an entry whose key is never read again is reclaimed rather
 *   than staying resident holding its events.
 * - **cache-hit rule**: a warm cache serves the result and fires no fetch; the
 *   fetch runs only on a miss, and the merged result is what the caller caches
 *   under its own query key, so author-relay results land in the same cache
 *   entry as pinned ones.
 * - **no negative caching**: only a non-empty result is cached. An empty result
 *   stays a miss, so an event that lands on the author's relay just after a cold
 *   miss is still reachable on the next read instead of being pinned invisible
 *   for the whole TTL.
 * - **single-flight**: concurrent cold-miss callers for the same logical read
 *   await one shared in-flight run, so N concurrent callers cost the relay
 *   budget of ONE read, not N serial fan-outs. Every step of that run — the
 *   declaration read included — is deadline-bounded, so a stuck run cannot be
 *   inherited by later callers for the key: it settles and clears.
 * - **merge**: per-relay results collapse through the seam's coordinate-level
 *   latest-wins rule (`mergeNdkEventSets`), so ordering semantics do not fork
 *   per relay class.
 * - **transport**: the per-relay fetches run through the loader-backed transport in
 *   `authorRelayLoader.ts`. A read an address pointer can express (the kind-0
 *   profile read, the kind-17375 wallet read) goes through the loader, which derives
 *   the filter from the pointer and drops an event a relay returns for a *different*
 *   coordinate; a `#p` inbox read, which no pointer can express, uses the same pool
 *   directly. The bounds above stay hand-rolled there — no `applesauce-loaders`
 *   loader can express the cap, the serial rule or the per-relay deadline.
 *
 * No new egress happens when the flag is OFF, when the purpose is an authority
 * read, or when the author declared no usable relays: the pinned result stands.
 *
 * Disclosure consequence (proposed in PR #1333 as a deliberate tradeoff; NOT yet recorded in the ADR): inside
 * this bound, an author's declared relay learns the reader's IP and that a
 * filter naming that author was requested. The bound exists to keep that
 * disclosure finite and legible.
