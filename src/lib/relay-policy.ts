/**
 * Stage-aware relay policy. Pure functions only — no store reads,
 * no NDK instance access, no DOM/network side effects. Callers in
 * `stores/ndk.ts` resolve the inputs (stage + the app relay from
 * configStore) and pass them in.
 *
 * Why this lives in its own file:
 *   - keeps `stores/ndk.ts` focused on NDK lifecycle (init/connect/
 *     signer wiring) without 100+ lines of policy mixed in;
 *   - makes each rule unit-testable in isolation — feed in
 *     `(stage, appRelay, ...)` and assert the output;
 *   - matches the way the policy gets used (computed once at boot
 *     + every time the watchdog re-evaluates), so co-locating the
 *     three resolvers helps future-me see the whole picture.
 *
 * Browser stages and what each one wants:
 *   - `production`: app relay + DEFAULT_PUBLIC_RELAYS for reads;
 *     all connected relays for writes (NDK default — return
 *     `undefined` for the write set so NDK fans out).
 *   - `staging` (covers auctionsdev and staging): app relay only
 *     for both reads and writes. We MUST NOT leak staging events
 *     to public discovery relays.
 *   - `development`: app relay only (typically `ws://localhost:10547`).
 *     Same reasoning as staging.
 *
 * The Bun server runtime also calls these with `LOCAL_RELAY_ONLY=true`
 * — `computeRelayUrls` accepts that flag explicitly rather than
 * sniffing `Bun.env` from inside the policy.
