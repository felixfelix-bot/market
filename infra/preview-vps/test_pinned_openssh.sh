# test_pinned_openssh.sh — every VPS connection in preview-deploy.yml must go
# through the OpenSSH helpers, pinned to the ed25519 host key.
#
# History: the workflow reached the VPS with appleboy/ssh-action and
# appleboy/scp-action. Those are Go programs (drone-ssh on
# golang.org/x/crypto/ssh) and their DEFAULT HostKeyAlgorithms negotiate a
# DIFFERENT host key than OpenSSH against this VPS. Measured 2026-09-11 against
# 23.182.128.51:22 with an unmodified Go ssh client:
#
#   OpenSSH -> ssh-ed25519         SHA256:rjbvoYsKckQMv/L9Y4LQNCx86z95pqonoNGmXdUS41M
#   Go      -> ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 SHA256:UTl0gzMwYlKNuORtrA8jxS7gmj9U1x8taGQh5vxaXQo
#
# One PREVIEW_VPS_HOST_FINGERPRINT secret cannot satisfy two SSH stacks that
# disagree about which host key to negotiate, so every appleboy step died with
#
#   ssh: handshake failed: ssh: host key fingerprint mismatch
#
# This test is what stops a Go-based SSH action from creeping back in and
# re-breaking the deploy. It is OFFLINE: the only socket it opens is to a closed
# port on 127.0.0.1, never the VPS.
#
# The same script guards the second, SILENT failure mode that killed every
# preview deploy while the pull request still looked green: a workflow file
# GitHub cannot PARSE. preview-deploy.yml spelled a literal placeholder back
# into a SHELL COMMENT inside a `run: |` body; GitHub scans those sequences for
# expression validity even when they sit in a shell comment, so it rejected the
# whole file at load time and created NO check run for it. PR #1271 therefore
# showed every check green while every deploy died (run 34653473352: zero jobs,
# no log, run name left as the truncated file path instead of "Preview
# Deploy"). Sections 5A and 5B below are the durable guards for that class.
