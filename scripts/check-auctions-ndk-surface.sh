# Auctions NDK-surface guard (ADR-0002, auctions publish seam).
#
# Fails if any PRODUCTION file in the auctions file set imports @nostr-dev-kit
# directly (a value import or `import type`) or touches the NDK store singleton
# (ndkActions / ndkStore). Auctions relay I/O, signing, and identity must go
# through the first-party seam at src/lib/nostr/io.ts instead.
#
# Scope: the production auctions file set only (tests are out of scope).
#
# Coverage (review 2026-09-18, item 1): the file set is NOT a hand-pinned list.
# It is assembled from pinned files that MUST exist plus glob families that MUST
# each match at least one file. If a pinned path disappears, or a family matches
# nothing, the guard FAILS instead of printing `OK` over a smaller (or empty)
# set — a silently blind guard is a gate regression. `scanned N` alone is not
# coverage evidence, so the coverage check runs before the grep. The unit tests
# set AUCTIONS_GUARD_REQUIRE_COVERAGE=0 for their throwaway repos; the real repo
# always runs strict.
#
# Out of scope (named, not silently ignored): `src/lib/stores/nip60.ts` carries
# 13 NDK-surface hits and is imported by nine auction production files, but it is
# the shared NIP-60 wallet store (NDKCashuWallet / NDKZapper). The earlier ADR-0002
# assignment of this file to the auctions team is SUPERSEDED: migrating the shared
# NIP-60 wallet store is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for the auctions-line migration
# and is tracked separately. It is deliberately NOT in the scanned set and NOT in
# the #1252 allowlist below.
#
# First-party wrapper: `src/lib/nostr/ndk-events.ts` re-exports NDK types and is
# part of the seam, not an auction file — auction files may import it. Six scanned
# files use it. This gate's literal `@nostr-dev-kit` grep cannot distinguish the
# wrapper from a direct import; the wrapper lives outside the scanned set and is
# the sanctioned pattern.
#
# Allowlist: NIP-59 / private-claim encryption needs the raw active signer
# object, which the library-agnostic I/O seam does not expose. Such files are
# gated on the signer-capability migration (PR #1252) and carry an explicit
# ALLOWLIST entry below. Do NOT re-export the NDK store under another name to
# slip past this guard — allowlist the file and cite #1252 instead.
