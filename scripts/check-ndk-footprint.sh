# NDK footprint guard for the NDK -> applesauce migration.
# (see docs/ndk-to-applesauce-migration-plan.md)
#
# Fails if the number of source files importing @nostr-dev-kit has INCREASED
# beyond the committed baseline. This prevents new NDK usage from sneaking in
# while the migration is underway — new relay I/O must route through the
# library-agnostic seam at src/lib/nostr/io.ts instead.
#
# When a wave REDUCES the footprint, that wave's PR should also lower the
# baseline in scripts/ndk-baseline.txt so the guard ratchets downward.
