"""strfry writePolicy plugin: dual-mode accept policy for the aggregator relay.

strfry invokes this plugin as a long-lived process and feeds it one JSON
object per line on stdin (see strfry docs/plugins.md). Each input line has the
shape::

    {"type":"new","event":{"id":...,"pubkey":...,"kind":...,"tags":...,
                            "content":...,"sig":...},
     "receivedAt":...,"sourceType":"...","sourceInfo":"..."}

For every line we print a single minified JSON object with ``id`` (echoed),
``action`` ("accept"|"reject") and an optional ``msg``.

DUAL-MODE POLICY
----------------
The aggregator relay runs in one of two modes (``$STRFRY_AGG_MODE``):

  * ``personal`` (default, vps2) — mirrors events relevant to the root npub.
  * ``plebeian``  (future)        — mirrors all market-relevant events from
                                    every participant.

Both modes share the same kind-based gate, which is what makes the relay a
useful aggregation point for *public* market data while still keeping
restricted kinds (gift-wraps, app-specific payloads) behind a WoT check:

  * PUBLIC market kinds (profiles, follows, relay lists, stall/product/
    auction events, badges, zap receipts, ratings...) are accepted from
    ANYONE. These are public by design — accepting them broadly is what lets
    the scraper mirror a complete market view.
  * RESTRICTED kinds (NIP-17 gift-wrap 1059/1060 and NIP-78 app-specific
    30078) are accepted ONLY from the root npub or the WoT allowlist,
    because they may carry private/payload data.
  * Everything else is rejected.

The allowlist (one hex pubkey per line) is read from
``$STRFRY_AGG_ALLOWED`` (default /opt/strfry-agg/state/allowed.npubs)
and reloaded automatically when its mtime changes, so the scraper's maintain
timer can update the served set without restarting the plugin or strfry.

The root npub's own events are always accepted (even before the first
reconcile populates the allowlist) so the relay can bootstrap. The root npub
hex is read from ``$STRFRY_AGG_ROOT_HEX``.
