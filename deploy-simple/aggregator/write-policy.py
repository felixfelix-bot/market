"""strfry writePolicy plugin: market-kind gate for Plebeian Market.

Accepts market-relevant events from ANY pubkey (the marketplace is open to
all sellers), plus the root npub's non-market events for bootstrap/personal
use. This replaces the original WoT-social gate which only accepted events
from the root npub's 2-hop follow set -- that excluded sellers outside the
operator's social graph, making their products invisible through the
aggregator (the primary production read relay).

strfry invokes this plugin as a long-lived process and feeds it one JSON
object per line on stdin (see strfry docs/plugins.md). Each input line:

    {"type":"new","event":{"id":..., "pubkey":..., "kind":..., "tags":...,...},
     "receivedAt":..., "sourceType":"...", "sourceInfo":"..."}

For every line we print a single minified JSON object with ``id`` (echoed),
``action`` ("accept"|"reject") and an optional ``msg``.

The optional allowlist (one hex pubkey per line) at
``$STRFRY_AGG_ALLOWED`` is still hot-reloaded on mtime change; it serves as
an ADDITIONAL allowlist on top of the kind gate for future use cases
(verified sellers, premium tier, etc.). It defaults to empty.

The root npub ($STRFRY_AGG_ROOT_HEX) is always accepted to bootstrap the
relay before any scrape/reconcile has populated the allowlist.
